Privacy Policy for FocusHub
Last updated: January 7th, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information when You use FocusHub and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.
1. Data Storage Philosophy
FocusHub is designed as a local-first productivity tool. We believe your data belongs to you. To ensure maximum privacy and offline accessibility:
On-Device Storage: All tasks, notes, focus points, and productivity stats are stored exclusively in your device's browser localStorage.
No Central Servers: FocusHub does not maintain databases or cloud servers that store your personal content. We cannot see, access, or sell your task lists.

2. Data Portability and Exports
We provide tools to help you move and secure your data at your discretion:
Manual Backups: You can generate a full application backup in .json format. This process gathers your local data and prepares it for export.
CSV Export: You can convert your current task views into a CSVF document for physical printing or digital archiving.
Sharing: When using the "Share" feature, your data is temporarily handed to the Android system to be sent via your chosen third-party app (e.g., Google Drive, Email). Once shared, the data is subject to that third party’s privacy policy.

3. Data Retention and Deletion
User-Controlled Deletion: You may permanently delete all application data by using the "Clear All Data" function in the Settings menu. This action is irreversible.
Browser Cleansing: Be aware that clearing your browser cache or "Site Data" on your Android device may result in the loss of your FocusHub data if you have not created a manual backup.

4. Security
Since your data never leaves your device (unless you explicitly share it), the security of your information depends on the security of your physical device. We recommend using device-level encryption and passcodes to protect your local storage.

5. Policy Updates
As we add new features—such as the "Export to PDF" or "Share" capabilities—this policy will be updated to reflect how those features interact with your data. You can always view the latest version via the link in our Utilities menu.

Data Privacy Summary
Personal Information: FocusHub does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, or phone number).

User Content: All tasks, notes, and data entered into the Eisenhower Matrix or Pomodoro Timer are stored locally on your device using web storage. This data is not accessible by the developer or any third party.

Push Notifications: FocusHub does not send push notifications. All alerts and timers occur locally within the application while it is in use.

Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

Application refers to FocusHub, the software program provided by the Company.

Company (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our") refers to FocusHub.

Service refers to the Application.

Collecting and Using Your Personal Data
Types of Data Collected
FocusHub does not collect Personal Data. Because the application operates entirely locally on your device, we do not require you to create an account, nor do we collect information such as your name, email, or physical location.

Usage Data
As an offline-first application, FocusHub does not automatically collect or transmit diagnostic data, IP addresses, or browser metadata to our servers.

Use of Your Data
Since we do not collect your data, we do not use it for marketing, profiling, or data analysis. Any data you enter into the app is used solely to provide the app’s functionality (tasks and timers) on your own device.

Delete Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete your data at any time. Because your data is stored locally on your device:

You can delete individual tasks or notes within the app.

You can clear the app's cache/data in your device settings.

You can uninstall the Application, which will remove all locally stored data.

Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. Because no data is transmitted to our servers, we do not "process" children's data.

Supplemental Notice for Residents of Florida, Nebraska, and Texas
If you are a resident of Florida, Nebraska, or Texas, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

Right to Access/Confirm: You may confirm if we are processing your data. (Note: We do not process or store your data on servers).

Right to Delete: You may delete your data by clearing your app cache or uninstalling the app.

Right to Opt-Out: You may opt out of the sale of data. (Note: FocusHub does not sell any user data).
